The "tank" is one of the most enduring fantasy archetypes ever. The Barbarian, protecting his companions from a mighty foe. The Paladin, an impassable wall holding back the forces of darkness. The Fighter, a whirlwind of steel and death that no enemy may pass unscathed. With how fundamental a part of the genre it is, anyone would reasonably expect that D&D - a game in this genre - would support it.

Except it doesn't. At every turn, D&D goes out of its way to be as brutal to characters who committed the cardinal sin of wanting to save their allies from danger.

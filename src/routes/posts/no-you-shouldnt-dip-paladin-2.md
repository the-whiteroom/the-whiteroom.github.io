It's no secret that people love Smite. Who wouldn't? It lets you roll more dice, and everybody loves that. You can even get Smite on your fullcasters with only two levels in Paladin - and even better, they can then smite better than any other class, burning their spell slots like wildfire.

Except Smite has a horrible, dark secret. It's not much damage, and it's never worth the cost of your precious spell slots, nor the danger it puts you in.

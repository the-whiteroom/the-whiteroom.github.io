Rogue is best described as a collection of features that feel strong, but aren't. Sneak Attack, Expertise, Cunning Action - almost every feature Rogues get fits this pattern. Falling behind other classes in many ways, Rogues struggle to find a niche - whether that's as a damage dealer, a skill monkey, or a skirmisher.

And yet, anybody who's played Rogue but not crunched the numbers will tell you that Rogues feel like they're contributing effectively. Why is that?

In a lot of ways, this can be attributed to the all-too-human tendency to remember the exceptions, the big events, the time the Rogue rolled high - even crit - on their Sneak attacks, or the time the Paladin did the same with Smite. Neither of these features are actually that much damage, but we never remember the averages, nor all the times they rolled low, so these features anecdotally feel much stronger than they actually are. It's the same reason sustained spells like Conjure Animals or Sleet Storm don't feel as powerful as they are - they aren't flashy. Our brains are simply just hardwired this way.

### Lacking in DPR
Sneak Attack can feel like a lot of damage when you're rolling a lot of dice, but Rogues just aren't effective damage dealers. In a game balanced around resource expenditure, the Rogue is unique in that it's almost totally resourceless. On-demand burst damage, which the Rogue lacks, is far more effective at killing enemies before they can harm the party than sustained damage. Additionally, Rogue's sustained DPR falls below Fighter Baseline, the absolute bare minimum to be considered a damage dealer.

Elven Accuracy is a popular choice on Rogues, but it's underwhelming. Only applying when you have advantage, it's less than an 8% increase to your hit chance (14.4% with Sharpshooter). It has no effect when you can't generate advantage.

### Skills
Rogues are supposed to be good at skill checks - and with the ease at which they reach high modifiers to their skill checks, you'd expect them to be. However, modifiers alone aren't indicative of how good you are - for example, the difference between a +3 and a +6 modifer isn't anywhere near twice as much, it's only 15%. Expertise is often touted as a fantastic boost to skill checks, but in actuality, other classes get comparable (or better) boost to skill checks.

The overwhelming majority of games are run below level 10, when Expertise is a 10-15% boost to 2-4 skills (of eighteen). Expertise is available to other classes too - for example, all Bards get two, Rangers get one, and many subclasses (like Knowledge) get it too. However, Expertise just isn't great.

For example, Guidance (available to Artificers, Clerics, and Druids) is a 12.5% increase to _every single skill_, in comparison to which Expertise's 10-15% boost to a couple skills looks downright pathetic. Magical Guidance, available to Sorcerers, grants a reroll to all skills for the tiny price of a single sorcery point - and a reroll is much better than Expertise, so this applying to all skills is the cherry on top. Races like Reborn and Dhampir also give boosts that far outpace Expertise. Bardic Inspiration is yet another "applies to every skill, gives a better bonus than Expertise" feature.

Reliable Talent feels good too. Never rolling below a 10? Sign me up! However, compared to just rolling a straight d20, it's only around a +3.325 to your average result - even less than Expertise at that level.

Additionally, many skill checks can be bypassed via spells like Suggestion.

Furthermore, fourteen of the eighteen skills are based off mental stats, and one off strength, none of which Rogues have any reason to invest in, particularly compared to casters that will naturally have much higher scores in these stats.

### Durability
Rogues _do_ have one resource - their health. It's not great, being a d8, on par with spellcasters like Bard, Cleric, and Warlock, and neither is their AC, being limited to light armor. This caps them at a maximum AC of 17, and many rogues, particularly those that invest in other stats to boost their skill checks, can't afford a super-high Constitution score either. In practice, Rogues need feats like Crossbow Expert and Sharpshooter, so they can't boost their DEX to +5 until very late in the game. When other classes beat 17AC out-of-the-box or with a single-level dip, Rogues are one of the least durable classes in the game. Their lack of access to potent defensive boosters like the *Shield* spell further worsens this.

### Skirmishing
It's often claimed that classes like Rogue or Monk can make up for their low durability by 'skirmishing' - a nebulously defined concept that usually involves running in and out of melee, somehow avoiding opportunity attacks along the way. However, even with Cunning Action, this just isn't possible, and trying to do so massively reduces Rogue's DPR.

In D&D, almost every player character has 30 or 35 feet of speed, and the overwhelming majority of monsters have at least 30 feet of speed. For player characters to effectively skirmish with monsters, they'd need more than 60 feet of movement - 30 to get in, and 30 to get out. No class even comes close to this.

Furthermore, going in and out of a monster's range provides opportunity attacks. Rogues can somewhat avoid this using the Mobile feat, or by being a Swashbuckler, which would almost work if there was only one monster on the battlefield. However, they still need to Dash as a bonus action, which means that their two main ways of generating Sneak Attack (Steady Aim and Cunning Action Hide) aren't available. They could also potentially generate Sneak Attack by having an unfortunate ally sit in melee with the monster, but no class in 5e can survive sitting in melee for that long, and will rapidly be turned into small chunks of ally.

### Poor subclasses
Rogue has the worst subclasses of any class in the game by a wide margin.
